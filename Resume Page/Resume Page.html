      <p>Self-taught young talent ready to dive into the Game Development world.
        Skilled gamer that have experience with many video game consoles but also
        a hard worker with nearly hundreds of mods worked on, I always find joy in
        anything video game related.
        With 2 personal projects to show and knowledge in programming and level design,
        I'm looking to start my career in the gaming industry, it doesn't matter if it is a game to test,
        a script to code, a character to design, a track to compose, I'm up for the challenge..
